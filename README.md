## Tokenizing the Real Estate Market

Abstract: 

Real estate investing is one of the most trusted investments that many have preferred for decades. 
Known for being a lucrative investment, it is a steady source of income in the form of lease and rents.
However, real estate investing has many downsides. People looking to invest in a property will be confronted with obstacles such as high transaction costs, land use regulations and other barriers to entry.

We believe that with the use of Blockchain technology, these issues can be addressed.
The idea is to enable shared property investments and fractional ownerships for all types of investors. 
This allows any individual who is familiar with blockchain to start investing without having to own a huge amount of capital.
Other advantages such as lower transaction fees (fewer intermediaries), increase in accessibility (foreign or local investors) and others can be results of tokeninzing this market.


## Project

Our goal is to represent properties as tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Investors, will be able to join a crowdfund of a real estate and later along the line receive dividends as their property generates income. 
Income could come from rents, appreciation, and many others. It will be divided evenly amongst the investors depending on how much Wei or Ether they invest.
